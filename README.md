## About The Project

Welcome! This repository contains a project developed while following the Udemy course "Next.js From Scratch" by Brad Traversy. The course was last updated in January 2025.

The goal of this project is to build a real-world property rental platform using modern technologies and best practices.

### Key Features

- Next.js Fundamentals – Learn and apply file-based routing, React Server Components, and data fetching.

- API Routes & Server Actions – Handle server-side logic and database operations seamlessly.

- MongoDB & Mongoose – Store and manage property data directly from server actions.

- Cloudinary Integration – Upload, store, and optimize property images with ease.

- Authentication & Authorization – Implemented with NextAuth.js and Google Provider.

- Internal Messaging System – Secure communication between property owners and renters.

- Bookmarks & Favorites – Save properties for quick access later.

- Search & Filtering – Find properties quickly based on criteria.

- Image Lightbox – Better property photo viewing experience.

- Pagination & Listings – Optimized for browsing large property catalogs.

### Project Outcome

By the end of this project, you’ll have a fully functional Property Rental Website built with Next.js 15+, connected to MongoDB, and powered by modern tools like NextAuth and Cloudinary.

It’s an excellent starting point for anyone looking to build real-world Next.js applications with authentication, database integration, and image management.
